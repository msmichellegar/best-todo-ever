# Best To Do App Ever

## What is this?

This is the best (modestly-named) to do app ever, built with Redis, Hapi.js, Riot.js and Socket.io. The app allows you to add to-dos and mark them as done in real time.

You can find a live demo [here](http://besttodo.herokuapp.com).

## Why did we build this?

We built this as a learning exercise in integrating Redis, Riot.js and Socket.io, as part of the [DWYL Summer](https://github.com/dwyl/summer-2015).
